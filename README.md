2-approximation-TSP
===================

Travelling salesman problem 2-approximation algorithm.

We first start with n randomized nodes which are all connected to each other.
We then use Prim's algorithm to create a Minimum Spanning Tree.
We then do a pre-order walk on the MST to get a tour.
Which gives us an approximate solution to the Travelling Salesman Problem.
